# Example Project Decisions

This is an example of how to document decisions in your project.

```ctx
type: decision
id: example-decision-001
status: accepted

**Decision**: Use React for the frontend framework.

**Rationale**: 
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Component-based architecture fits our needs
- Team has existing React experience

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vue.js (smaller ecosystem)
- Angular (too heavyweight for our needs)

**Decided At**: 2026-01-15
```
