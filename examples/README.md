# Examples

This directory contains examples of using TruthLayer.

## Example Project

See [`example-project/`](example-project/) for a simple example of how to structure your project documentation using TruthLayer.

The example includes:
- `CONTEXT.md` - Project context and goals
- `DECISIONS.md` - Architecture decisions

These are fictional examples meant to demonstrate the approach. For a real-world example, see the project root files (`CONTEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, etc.) which use the system to document this project itself.
