# Optional Integrations

TruthLayer supports multiple entry points without compromising governance.

## Chat/voice assistants

- Assistants query accepted truth
- Draft proposals with structured operations
- Link proposals for human review

## VSCode extension

- Render projections alongside code
- Inline comments mapped to node/field anchors
- “Create proposal from selection” actions

## Git hosting (GitHub/GitLab)

- Store projections in repos
- CI checks: ensure projection matches accepted revision
- PRs can be converted into proposals via change detection

## OpenClaw / agent orchestrators

- Treat TruthLayer as the “truth substrate”
- Agents read accepted truth, propose deltas
- Human review gates applying changes
