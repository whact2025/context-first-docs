# Maintainer docs

This folder holds **meta-documentation** for maintainers, not for customers or evaluators.

- **DOCS_ANALYSIS.md** — Reanalysis of doc consistency, source-of-truth decision, and alignment of root to docs/. Use when updating the doc set or onboarding maintainers.

Do not include this folder in any published or customer-facing doc pack.
