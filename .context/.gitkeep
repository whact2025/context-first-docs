# Context Store Directory

This directory will contain the canonical context store data (JSON/YAML files)
once file-based persistence is implemented.

The context store is the source of truth. Markdown files in the project root
(`CONTEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `RISKS.md`, `QUESTIONS.md`) are
projections of this store.

See `.context/README.md` for more details.
